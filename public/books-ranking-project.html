<h2>Book Recommendations and Personal Reviews by Marielle</h2>

<h3>The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy, Ian McMahon</h3>
<p>This is the first book that I read this November. The Power of Your Subconscious Mind is a treasure that very few people have yet discovered, 
and the answer to the mysteries that is only encountered by those who are seeking for the merge of spirituality and scientific explanation about life. 
This is my top favorite book so far!</p>

<h3>Mastery by Robert Greene</h3>
<p>I'll be biased, Robert Greene is my favorite author. Although I'm still in the half part of the book, Mastery served as my guide 
and my current mentor in seeing the bigger picture and focusing more on the things that matter. This book helped me stay grounded and motivated to get 
up and make valuable things happen.</p>

<h3>Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay C. Gibson</h3>
<p>This book is quite a heavy read and I'm still in the middle of it. This was shared to me by a friend before, and she mentioned that this was recommended by her 
psychiatrist so she could understand herself better. I'm really grateful that I had accessed this book! This helped me become more aware of myself and of the characters of different individuals.</p>
