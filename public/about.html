<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Marielle, a web developer building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites using HTML and CSS. With a strong background in online work and digital support, I bring structure, clarity, and attention to detail into every web project I create.</p>

<p>I started working online at a young age and later gained experience through professional training and real-world projects. As I transition into web development, I focus on building practical websites such as portfolios, ranking pages, and landing pages that are easy to use and well-structured.</p>

<p>My goal is to create simple, functional websites that make it easy for users to navigate content and help clients achieve their objectives.</p>
